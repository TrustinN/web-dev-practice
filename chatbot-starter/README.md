# Chatbot Starter Template

A super minimal chatbot starter template using modern [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Substrate](https://substrate.run). Built to be as concise as possible with few dependencies, so it's easy to fork.
- Renders streaming UI
- Handles chat history
- Modern, polished React UI with minimal dependencies

We're planning to extend this a bunch with things like speech-to-text input, text-to-speech output, memory, and more. File an issue if there are features you want to see us build! 

Currently the chatbot is food/cooking themed, but it's easy to extend.
